1. What is a Neuron?
    * The objective behind inventing neural networks was to build a software that mimics the human brain and how it thinks.

    * Neurons are the basic building block of the brain and the entire nervous system.
    * They are specialized cells responsible for transmitting and processing information through electrical and chemical signals.
    * Neurons work together in networks to control all brain functions.

    * The artificial neural network uses a simplified mathematical model of the biological neuron.

2. Why Now?
    * Neural networks have been around for decades and recently taken off due to:
        . Data explosion: large amounts of data are available.
        . Scalability of NNs: neural networks can improve performance as they process more data.
        . Hardware advancements: particularly GPUs.
