1. Regression with Decision Trees:
    * Decision trees can also be used for regression tasks, which means to predict a number.
    * The feature to split on at a node is choosed based on the one that reduces variance the most.
    * Variance reduction is calculated as:
        . Variance Reduction = Variance(root) - (w_left * Variance(left) + w_right * Variance(right))
