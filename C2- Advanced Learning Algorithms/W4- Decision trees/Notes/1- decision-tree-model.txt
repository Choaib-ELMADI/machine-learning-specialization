1. Decision Trees:
    * Decision trees are powerful and widely used in machine learning, particularly in competitions, despite receiving less attention in academia.
    * The algorithm evaluates multiple possible trees and selects one that performs well on training data while generalizing effectively to new data.

2. Decision Trees Terminology:
    * Root Node: the starting point of the tree, representing the first decision.
    * Decision Nodes: nodes that make decisions based on features and guide the path down the tree.
    * Leaf Nodes: terminal nodes that provide predictions.

3. How It Works?
    * Start at the root node and evaluate a feature.
    * Depending on the feature's value, follow the left or right branch.
    * Repeat until reaching a leaf node that predicts the output.

4. Learning Process:
    * The process of building a decision tree has a few steps:
        . Decide the feature to use to split on at each node:
            - Maximize purity (or minimize impurity)

        . Stop splitting:
            - Having a node with 100% one class
            - Do not exceed the tree's maximum depth
            - Improvements in purity score are below a threshold
            - The number of examples in a node is below a threshold
