1. Iterative Loop of ML Development:
    * Step 1: Choose architecture (model, data, etc)
    * Step 2: Train model
    * Step 3: Diagnostics (bias, variance and error analysis), then Step 1

2. Error Analysis:
    * For example, for a cross validation set of 500 training examples, the algorithm misclassifies 100 of them.
    * Manually examining these 100 examples will help detect the issue and resolve the problem.

3. Adding Data:
    * Add more data of everything
    * Add more data of the types where error analysis occurred
    * Data augmentation: modifying existing examples, introducing distortions
    * Data synthesis: creating new examples

4. Transfer Learning:
    * Transfer learning is a technique that let's you use data from another task to work with your application.
        > This is called: supervised pretraining.

    * There are 2 options to implement this:
        . Only train output layer's parameters
        . Train all parameters
        > This is called: fine-tuning.

5. Full Cycle of a ML Project:
    * Define project scope
    * Define and collect data
    * Training, error analysis and iterative improvement
    * Deploy, monitor and maintain system
