1. Bias and Variance:
    * High bias refers to underfitting issue:
        . J_train is high
        . J_cv is high

    * High variance refers to overfitting issue:
        . J_train is low
        . J_cv is high

2. Regularization and Bias/Variance:
    * A high value for the regularization parameter will cause underfitting.
    * A small value for the regularization parameter will cause overfitting.

3. Establishing a Baseline Level of Performance:
    * We consider that we have a high bias when the gap between the baseline performance and the training error is larger.
    * We consider that we have a high variance when the gap between the the training error and the cross validation error is larger.

4. Learning Curves:
    * A learning curve is a graph of cost error and training set size.

    * For high bias, more training examples wont help improving the model's performance.
    * For high variance, more training examples will actually help improve the model's performance.
