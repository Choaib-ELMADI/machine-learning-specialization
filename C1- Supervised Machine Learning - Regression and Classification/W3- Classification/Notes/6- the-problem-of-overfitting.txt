1. What is Underfitting and Overfitting?
    * Underfitting is when a model does not fit the training data very well:
        . There is a clear pattern in the data that the model is unable to capture.
        . Another naming for this issue is the model has a "high bias".

    * Overfitting is when a model fits the training data extremely well but can't be generalized for new data points:
        . Another naming for this issue is the model has a "high variance".

2. Addressing Overfitting:
    * There are many ways to address the problem of overfitting:
        . Collect more training examples
        . Select features to include or exclude, AKA: Feature selection
        . Reduce size of parameters, AKA: Regularization
