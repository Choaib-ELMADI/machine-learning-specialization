1. Polynomial Regression Implementation:
    * Polynomial regression is a type of supervised learning that helps fit not straight lines but curves.
    * It can be implemented using multiple linear regression combined with feature engineering.

    * Note that it's important to apply feature scaling when doing feature engineering.
