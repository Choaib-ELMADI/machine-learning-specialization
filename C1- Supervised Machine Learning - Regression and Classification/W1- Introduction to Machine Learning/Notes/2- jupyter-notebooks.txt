1. What is Jupyter Notebook?
    * Jupyter Notebook is an open-source tool that allows you to create and share documents that combine code, text, visualizations, and interactive outputs.
    * It is widely used for data analysis, machine learning, and scientific computing.

    * Jupyter Notebooks are composed of two types of cells:
        . Markdown cells: used to write text, add headings, and format content using Markdown.
        . Code cells: used to write and run code, displaying outputs directly below the cell.

2. Working with Jupyter Notebook:
    * To use Jupyter Notebook, you need to install the necessary libraries and tools.

    * Option 1: For Browser-Based Use
        > Install Jupyter Notebook: pip install notebook
        > Start Jupyter Notebook: jupyter notebook
        > You can create, edit, and manage ".ipynb" files directly in the browser

    * Option 2: For VS Code Integration
        > Install the required libraries: pip install notebook ipykernel
        > Install the Jupyter extension in VS Code
        > Open or create a ".ipynb" file in VS Code

3. Working with Python Virtual Environments:
    * Using a virtual environment helps isolate your project dependencies and avoid conflicts.

    * Step 1: Create a virtual environment
        > python -m venv MyVenvName

    * Step 2: Activate the virtual environment
        > On Windows: MyVenvName\Scripts\activate
        > On Mac\Linux: source MyVenvName/bin/activate

    * Step 3: Add the virtual environment to Jupyter
        > Install necessary libraries...
        > python -m ipykernel install --user --name=MyVenvName --display-name "Python (MyVenvName)"

    * Step 4: Use the virtual environment in Jupyter
        > Launch Jupyter Notebook
        > In the notebook interface, select the kernel corresponding to your virtual environment

    * Step 5: Deactivate the virtual environment
        > deactivate
