1. What is Machine Learning?
    * Machine learning is the science of getting computers to learn without being explicitly programmed.

2. Applications of Machine Learning:
    * Perform web search
    * Recognize human speech
    * Diagnose diseases from X-rays
    * Build self-driving cars
    * ...

3. Machine Learning Algorithms:
    -> Supervised Learning
    -> Unsupervised Learning

4. Supervised Learning:
    * Supervised learning refers to the algorithms that learn x to y or input to output mappings.
    * The key characteristic of supervised learning is that you give your learning algorithm examples to learn from:
        . The correct label "y" for a given input "x".
        . Then, after training, they can take a new input "x" and try to produce the appropriate corresponding output "y".

    * Regression is a type of supervised learning algorithms where the goal is to predict a number from infinitely many possible numbers.

    * Classification is a type of supervised learning algorithms where the goal is to predict a label from a limited set of possible categories.

5. Unsupervised Learning:
    * Unsupervised learning refers to the algorithms that find patterns or structures in data without specific input-to-output mappings.

    * Clustering is a type of unsupervised learning where the algorithm groups data into clusters (groups) based on patterns or similarities.

    * Anomaly detection is a type of unsupervised learning where the algorithm identifies data points that do not fit the usual pattern of the data:
        . These points are called "anomalies" or "outliers".

    * Dimensionality reduction is a type of unsupervised learning where the algorithm simplifies data by reducing the number of features while preserving important information.
