1. What is a Cost Function?
    * The cost function measures how well the model is performing.

    * Parameters of a model are the variables you adjust during training to improve the model's accuracy:
        . In linear regression, the parameters are w (weight) and b (bias).
        . Parameters are also referred to as "coefficients" or "weights".

    * The y-intercept is the point where the line crosses the vertical axis (y-axis) on the graph:
        . In the function f(x) = w * x + b, b represents the y-intercept.

    * The slope determines the steepness or angle of the line on the graph:
        . In the function f(x) = w * x + b, the value of w represents the slope.
        . The slope is calculated as the change in y divided by the change in x (Δy/Δx).
