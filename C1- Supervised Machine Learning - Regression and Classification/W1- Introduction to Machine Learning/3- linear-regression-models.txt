1. Machine Learning Terminology:
    * Training Set: the dataset used to train a model.
    * Model: the algorithm that learns from the training set to make predictions.
    * Input Variable (Feature or Input Feature): the variable used as input for the model, often denoted by x.
    * Output Variable (Target Variable): the variable that the model aims to predict, often denoted by y.
    * Training Example: a single data point in the dataset, represented as a pair (x, y).

2. Univariate Linear Regression:
    * It's a linear regression algorithm with one variable (single feature x):
        . f_w,b(x) = w * x + b
