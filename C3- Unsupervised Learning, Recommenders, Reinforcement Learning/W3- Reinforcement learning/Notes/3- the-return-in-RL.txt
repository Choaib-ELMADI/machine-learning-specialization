1. What is the Return?
    * The total accumulated reward an agent receives over time.
    * Future rewards are weighted less using a discount factor (Gamma γ).
    * Encourages faster rewards and penalizes long delays.

2. Discount Factor (Gamma):
    * A value slightly less than 1 (0.9, 0.99) or lower for illustrations (0.5).
    * Makes the agent slightly "impatient" - prefers rewards sooner.
    * Weighs future rewards:
        . Return = R1 + γ¹*R2 + γ²*R3 + γ³*R4 + ...

3. Mars Rover Example:
    * Always going left from state 4 (with Gamma = 0.5):
        . State 4 → 3 → 2 → 1 (reward = 100)
        . Return = 0 + 0 + 0 + 0.5³*100 = 12.5

    * Always going right from state 4 (with Gamma = 0.5):
        . State 4 → 5 → 6 (reward = 40)
        . Return = 0 + 0 + 0.5²*40 = 10

4. Flexible Action Strategies:
    * Instead of always left or right, choose based on current state:
        . Go left in states 2, 3, 4
        . Go right in state 5

5. Negative Rewards and Time Preference:
    * Discounting helps delay bad outcomes.
    * Agent is incentivized to delay penalties into the future.
