1. What is Reinforcement Learning?
    * A branch of machine learning focused on learning by interaction.
    * Unlike supervised learning, RL does not require labeled input-output pairs.
    * The agent learns what to do, not how to do it, through trial and error and rewards.

2. Real-World RL Example (Autonomous Helicopter):
    * A Stanford helicopter was trained using RL to perform stunts like flying upside down.
    * State = helicopter's position, orientation, speed, ...
    * Action = how to move control sticks to keep it balanced.
    * Instead of hardcoding actions, RL learns them from experience.

3. Rewards and Learning Process:
    * Inspired by training a dog:
        . "Good dog" (positive reward) when behavior is good.
        . "Bad dog" (negative reward) when behavior is bad.

    * Helicopter example:
        . +1 reward per second flying well.
        . -1000 reward for crashing.

    * The RL agent maximizes cumulative reward over time.

4. Applications of Reinforcement Learning:
    * Robotics - like training a robotic dog to cross obstacles.
    * Factory operations - optimizing layouts and workflows.
    * Finance - sequencing trades efficiently to minimize losses.
    * Games - mastering complex games like Chess, Go, and Bridge.
    * Simulation - practical example landing a lunar lander.
