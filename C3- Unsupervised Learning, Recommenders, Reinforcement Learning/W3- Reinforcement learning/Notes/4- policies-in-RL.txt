1. What is a Policy (π)?
    * A function that maps a state (S) to an action (A).
    * Written as: π(S) = A
    * Tells the agent what action to take in each state.

2. Examples of Policies:
    * Always go to the nearer reward.
    * Always go to the larger reward.
    * Go left unless you're one step away from the smaller reward, then go right.
    * Any consistent mapping of states to actions is considered a valid policy.

3. Goal of Reinforcement Learning:
    * To learn an optimal policy π that maximizes the return from every state.
    * π should choose actions that lead to the highest possible total reward over time.

4. Terminology:
    * "Policy" is the standard term, though "controller" might be more intuitive.
    * Widely accepted in the RL community: π = agent's behavior strategy.
