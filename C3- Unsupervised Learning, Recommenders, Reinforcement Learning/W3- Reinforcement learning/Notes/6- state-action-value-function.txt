1. What is the State-Action Value Function?
    * Denoted as Q(S, A), also called the Q-function.
    * It gives the return starting from state S, taking action A once, and then following the optimal policy afterward.
    * Although the definition seems circular (needs the optimal policy), we'll learn algorithms to compute Q(S, A) even before knowing the optimal policy.

2. How to Derive the Optimal Policy:
    * For any state S, the best action is:
        . A = maxₐ Q(S, A)
        . This gives the action that yields the highest possible return.

    * Once Q(S, A) is known, π(S) = maxₐ Q(S, A) becomes the optimal policy.
