1. Continuous State Spaces:
    * In earlier examples like the Mars Rover, the state S was discrete (one of six states).
    * In real-world robotic control problems, S is often continuous.

2. Example - Self-driving Car / Truck:
    * State S may include:
        . X → position in horizontal direction
        . Y → position in vertical direction
        . Θ → orientation angle
        . Ẋ → speed in X direction
        . Ẏ → speed in Y direction
        . Θ̇ → rate of change of orientation

    * S is now a vector of 6 continuous values.

3. Example - Autonomous Helicopter:
    * To describe helicopter's position:
        . X → north-south
        . Y → east-west
        . Z → altitude

    * To describe orientation:
        . Φ (Phi)   → roll
        . Θ (Theta) → pitch
        . Ω (Omega) → yaw

    * To describe velocity and angular velocity:
        . Ẋ, Ẏ, Ż → linear velocity
        . Φ̇, Θ̇, Ω̇ → angular velocity

    * So S is a vector of 12 real-valued numbers.
