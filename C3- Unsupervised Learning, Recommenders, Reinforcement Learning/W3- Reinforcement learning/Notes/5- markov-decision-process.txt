1. Key Components of Reinforcement Learning:
    * State (S): the current situation the agent is in.
    * Action (A): the possible moves the agent can take.
    * Reward (R(S)): feedback signal from the environment.
    * Discount Factor (Gamma): downweights future rewards.
    * Return: total discounted reward over time.
    * Policy (π): function that maps a state to an action.

2. Markov Decision Process (MDP):
    * The formal name for this RL setup.
    * "Markov" = next state depends only on the current state and action, not the full history.
    * Visualized as:
        . Agent in state S takes action A (π(S) = A).
        . Environment responds with next state S' and reward R.
