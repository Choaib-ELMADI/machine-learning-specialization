1. What is Content-Based Filtering?
    * A different approach from collaborative filtering.
    * Recommends items based on:
        . Features of the user
        . Features of the item
    * Goal: Find matches between users and items using their respective features.

2. Collaborative Filtering vs. Content-Based Filtering:
    * Collaborative Filtering:
        . Uses user-item rating patterns (who rated what and how).
        . Learns parameters (like w(j) and b(j)) from known ratings.
    * Content-Based Filtering:
        . Uses explicit features of users and items.
        . Learns representations from those features to make predictions.

3. How Content-Based Filtering Works?
    * Define:
        . xᵤ(j): Raw features of user j.
        . xₘ(i): Raw features of movie i.
    * Transform features into vectors:
        . vᵤ(j): Vector representing user j's preferences.
        . vₘ(i): Vector representing movie i's characteristics.
    * Prediction:
        . Rating predicted as: vᵤ(j) * vₘ(i)
        . Both vᵤ and vₘ must be same size, even if original features differ in size.
