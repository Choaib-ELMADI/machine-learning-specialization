1. K-means Cost Function:
    * Like supervised learning, K-means also minimizes a cost function, called the distortion function.
    * The algorithm itself (not gradient descent) reduces this cost through alternating steps.

    * The cost function is the average squared distance between each training example x(i) and the centroid ų_c(i) of the cluster it's assigned to.
    > c(i) is the index of the cluster assigned to point x(i).

2. Each K-means Step Minimizes the Cost:
    * Assign Points (Update c(i)):
        . Assign each point to the nearest cluster centroid --> minimizes its squared distance.
    * Move Centroids (Update ų_k):
        . Move each centroid to the mean of the points assigned to it --> reduces overall distortion.
