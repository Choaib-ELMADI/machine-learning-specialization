1. Finding Unusual Events:
    * Anomaly detection is an unsupervised learning algorithm that identifies data points that deviate from normal patterns.

    * How it works:
        . Train on normal data to learn the distribution of typical feature values.
        . For a new example, compute the probability p(x) of observing it.
        . If p(x) < epsilon (a small threshold), flag it as an anomaly.

2. What is the Gaussian (Normal) Distribution?
    * Also known as the bell-shaped distribution.
    * Defined by two parameters: mean (mu: μ) and variance (sigma²: σ²).
    * Probability of x follows the formula: p(x) = 1 / (sqrt(2 * pi * σ²)) * e^(-(x - μ)² / (2 * σ²)), where:
        . μ is the mean
        . σ² is the variance
        . σ is the standard deviation

3. How μ and σ Affect the Distribution:
    * Changing μ shifts the center of the curve.
    * Changing σ adjusts the width.
    * Area under the curve is always 1 (total probability = 1).

4. Fitting a Gaussian to Training Data:
    * For m training examples x₁, ..., xₘ:
        . Estimate μ = (1/m) ∑ xᵢ
        . Estimate σ² = (1/m) ∑ (xᵢ - μ)²

    * These are the maximum likelihood estimates.
    * Gives a Gaussian distribution that likely fits the data source.
