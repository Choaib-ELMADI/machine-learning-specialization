1. Finding Unusual Events:
    * Anomaly detection is an unsupervised learning algorithm that identifies data points that deviate from normal patterns.

    * How it works:
        . Train on normal data to learn the distribution of typical feature values.
        . For a new example, compute the probability p(x) of observing it.
        . If p(x) < epsilon (a small threshold), flag it as an anomaly.
