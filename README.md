# Machine Learning Specialization

Welcome to my repository for the `Machine Learning Specialization` on Coursera, offered by `DeepLearning.AI` in collaboration with `Stanford Online`. This repository contains my notes, code implementations, and projects from the 3-course series.

## About the Specialization

The Machine Learning Specialization is an updated and expanded version of Andrew Ng's pioneering Machine Learning course. Taught by **Andrew Ng**, this beginner-friendly program provides a comprehensive introduction to modern machine learning. It covers supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and key best practices used in the field.

## Courses in the Specialization

### Course 1| Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification

Learn the fundamentals of predictions, regression, and classification tasks. There are 3 modules in this course:

1. **Week 1|** Introduction to Machine Learning

2. **Week 2|** Regression with multiple input variables

3. **Week 3|** Classification

### Course 2| Advanced Learning Algorithms

Explore decision trees, ensemble methods, and neural network training.

### Course 3| Unsupervised Learning, Recommenders, Reinforcement Learning

Dive into clustering, anomaly detection, recommender systems, and deep reinforcement learning.

## Learning Goals

By completing this specialization, I aim to:

- Build machine learning models in Python using libraries like NumPy and scikit-learn.
- Train and evaluate supervised models such as linear regression, logistic regression, and neural networks.
- Implement unsupervised learning techniques like clustering and dimensionality reduction.
- Build recommender systems and deep reinforcement learning models.
- Apply best practices for model evaluation and improvement.

## Repository Contents

- **Notes**: Summaries of concepts, techniques, and formulas covered in the courses.
- **Projects**: Hands-on projects implementing ML models and algorithms.
- **Code**: Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks for course exercises.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: NumPy, scikit-learn, TensorFlow
- **Tools**: Jupyter Notebook, Git

## Acknowledgements

This specialization is taught by **Andrew Ng**, a renowned AI researcher and educator, and is developed in partnership with DeepLearning.AI and Stanford Online.
